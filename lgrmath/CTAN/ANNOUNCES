Description:

The lgrmath package is a LaTeX package which sets the Greek
letters in math mode to use glyphs from the LGR-encoded font of
oneâ€™s choice.  The documentation includes a rather extensive list
of the available font family names on typical LaTeX installations.

The package allows to easily configure math mode to use either
upright or italic/slanted shapes, and all Greek letters are always
available also via \...up and \...it named macros (what `up' and
`it' mean is configured by package options).  Typically, this
package is for users who have already modified Latin letters in
math mode, e.g. via package frenchmath or mathastext, and who wish
to match them with some suitable font for Greek symbols.
