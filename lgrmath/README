    This is the README file for the LaTeX2e package
    `lgrmath', version 1.0 of 2022/11/16.

    and version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of
    LaTeX version 2003/12/01 or later.

    This Work includes lgrmath.sty, the documentation
    lgrmath.pdf, this README and the source lgrmath.dtx.

With \usepackage[font=<...>]{lgrmath} the Greek letters in math
mode will be from the given font name, assumed to exist on the
LaTeX installation in LGR encoding for traditional LaTeX/pdfLaTeX.

The shape of the Greek letters are configured via package
options, and they also come in \...up and \...it variants.

Manual installation:
--------------------

Execute                  This creates

    etex lgrmath.dtx         lgrmath.sty
                             lgrmath.tex

The first one is the package file.  The second one is for
building the PDF documentation.  To do the latter:

    latexmk  lgrmath.tex
    dvipdfmx lgrmath.dvi

The PDF documentation then includes the commented source code.

It is possible to run latex + dvipdfmx, pdflatex, lualatex, or
xelatex directly on lgrmath.dtx rather than on lgrmath.tex.
The PDF will then not include the commented source code.
